- Live Site URL: [Vercel deployed](https://front-end-mentor-practise.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to apply my previous learnings from the other two projects I did (components only) to this webpage. I was able to play around with margins and other components to match the exact style but keeping my own social media links to this site

### Continued development

I feel like there can be more to this page like i could improvise on the colour patterns rather than the given one.
