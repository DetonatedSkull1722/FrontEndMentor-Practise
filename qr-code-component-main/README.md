## My process

  I am very new to webdev so this is my first challenge on frontend-mentor 
  I have made 4 containers which i think i could have removed if centering a div was easy :)
  But these containers are set up correctly to work with the centering of the website and the responsiveness of the elements inside.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

  1. I learnt how to work with box-shadows to provide a fake 3d effect
  2. I revised a lot of concepts that i had learnt before with my courses
  3. I got to learn important media query adjustments that i had forgotten
  4. I used chatgpt on the side to debug my code and breaking of the website (added skill :) ).

### Continued development

  1. Reduce the number of containers used as i think if any changes made might breakt he website to some extent that might make it hard to work with 
  2. Transitional effects while screen size is changing 

### Useful resources
  1. udemy courses by Dr. Angela Yu.
